title: About Stephen
---

I am a happily married man married to my happily married wife. We just had our first child and couldn't be happier or more tired. I've spent most of my days working in the world of technology, specifically around web development. 

## Skills

I've accumulated some skills down through the years in regards to my career. I spent my time at the university studying network security and system administration, and I've spent most of my professional career programming. At my current job at a manufacturing plant, I'm more of an analyst who spends his time finding slick ways to get processes done. This usually involves purchasing software or building custom systems.

### Technology specifics

* _Django_ - I spent several years working in Django, and I'm very comfortable with it and everything Python. I haven't programmed in Django for a couple of years, though I've been keeping up with it.
* _Ruby on Rails_ - I do most of my current stuff in Rails. I've built several systems with Rails along with a few REST APIs. I am very comfortable in Rails and Ruby, and try hard to write clean, well-tested code.

### Projects

[KATE](https://github.com/katemsu/kate_website) - I worked at the [Kentucky Academy of Technology Education](http://kate.murraystate.edu) for several years. There, I worked primarily in Django. The director was kind enough to let us open source the project. Since working on this project, I've changed a lot of my development practices, so if the lack of tests hurts your soul, just know it hurts mine, too.

## Interests

I love spending time with family. As I write this, I'm watching my little girl stretch and poop as she wakes from a nap. It really doesn't get much better than this.

I enjoy reading, though I don't do enough of it. I love to read old theology books. I like to play music on our out-of-tune piano. I'm also slowly starting to enjoy running again, though it's still painful.

My wife and I enjoy watching good TV shows. We have spent entirely way too much time enjoying shows, but there are just so many good ones out there.
