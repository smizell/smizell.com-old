      <section>
        <p>I am a happily married man married to my happily married wife. We just had our first child and couldn&#8217;t be happier or more tired. I&#8217;ve spent most of my days working in the world of technology, specifically around web development. </p>

<h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve accumulated some skills down through the years in regards to my career. I spent my time at the university studying network security and system administration, and I&#8217;ve spent most of my professional career programming. At my current job at a manufacturing plant, I&#8217;m more of an analyst who spends his time finding slick ways to get processes done. This usually involves purchasing software or building custom systems.</p>

<h3 id="technology-specifics">Technology specifics</h3>

<ul>
  <li><em>Django</em> - I spent several years working in Django, and I&#8217;m very comfortable with it and everything Python. I haven&#8217;t programmed in Django for a couple of years, though I&#8217;ve been keeping up with it.</li>
  <li><em>Ruby on Rails</em> - I do most of my current stuff in Rails. I&#8217;ve built several systems with Rails along with a few REST APIs. I am very comfortable in Rails and Ruby, and try hard to write clean, well-tested code.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="projects">Projects</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/katemsu/kate_website">KATE</a> - I worked at the <a href="http://kate.murraystate.edu">Kentucky Academy of Technology Education</a> for several years. There, I worked primarily in Django. The director was kind enough to let us open source the project. Since working on this project, I&#8217;ve changed a lot of my development practices, so if the lack of tests hurts your soul, just know it hurts mine, too.</p>

<h2 id="interests">Interests</h2>

<p>I love spending time with family. As I write this, I&#8217;m watching my little girl stretch and poop as she wakes from a nap. It really doesn&#8217;t get much better than this.</p>

<p>I enjoy reading, though I don&#8217;t do enough of it. I love to read old theology books. I like to play music on our out-of-tune piano. I&#8217;m also slowly starting to enjoy running again, though it&#8217;s still painful.</p>

<p>My wife and I enjoy watching good TV shows. We have spent entirely way too much time enjoying shows, but there are just so many good ones out there. </p>
